# QTM-UE-TD-OSC_Example
Motion Capture Group Project
- Group Member：Weitong Sun，Hanna Irace, Olivia Gwinner, Gaby Wilk
- We used Qualysis and Unreal Engine LiveLink to get real-time motion capture data into UE5
- We then send OSC messages through UE5 to Touchdesigner
- In Touchdesigner, we use the xyz location data we got from UE5 to trigger sound effects
