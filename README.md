# QTM-UE-TD-OSC_Example
Motion Capture Group Project 
(Group Memberï¼šWeitong Sun, Hanna Irace, Olivia Gwinner, Gaby Wilk)
- We used Qualisys QTM and Unreal Engine LiveLink to get real-time motion capture data from Qualisys into UE5
- We then send OSC messages through UE5 to Touchdesigner
- In Touchdesigner, we use the xyz location data we got from UE5 to trigger sound effects
